        <h2>Vegetative Cycle</h2>
        
        <div class="grow-content-weekly">
        <h3>Week 1 <i class="fas fa-calendar-alt"></i></h3>
        <p>Clones were grown in rockwool cubes inside a tent under a T5 light until they were big enough and the season started for outdoor cannabis growing in Colorado. The clones are being hand watered with Clonex Root Solution daily after week 1 until transplant.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="grow-content-weekly">
        <h3>Week 3 <i class="fas fa-calendar-alt"></i></h3>
        <p>Clones were transplanted into <a href="http://www.grodan101.com/products/pargro-stonewool/pargro-quick-drain">Grodan's Pargro QD blocks</a> during week 3 prior to being hardened to the outside sun. Granular mycorrhiza innoculants were used inside the block prior to placing the clone cubes inside, where it will make direct contact with roots. Plants are currently receiving vegetative feed using the General Hydroponics 3-part FloraSeries until they are placed outside in the ground during week 5 of the vegetative phase.</p>

        <div class="grow-content-weekly">
        <h3>Week 5 <i class="fas fa-calendar-alt"></i></h3>
        <p>Plants have been getting acclimated to the Sun by placing the plants directly outdoors for a few hours at a time for the past week until they are placed into the ground. During week 5 of the vegetative phase, Plants are ready to be transitioned from T5 lighting inside a tent, to the outdoors after having been hardened to the Sun's powerful light for the past week. The plants are placed about 3ft apart in distance from one another. There is a PVC structure to support the trellis that will train the plants and to tie tarp around for when the weather gets severe. The ground was tilled and Fox Farm Happy Frog and Fox Farm Ocean Forest soils were added to the ground. Additional companion plants were planted around the cannabis plants to encourage beneficial insects to call my garden their home.</p>

        <div class="grow-content-weekly">
        <h3>Week 6 <i class="fas fa-calendar-alt"></i></h3>
        <p>The plant was trellised during week 6 of the vegetative phase and has a PVC temporary structure for its support. There is a healthy population of ladybugs which I believe is partly due to the companion plants. I spotted aphids in the garden on the undersides and topsides of the cannabis leaves and started to regularly spray <a href="http://www.gardensafe.com/products/fungicide/neem-oil-extract-concentrate.aspx">Garden Safe’s Neem Oil Extract</a> twice weekly until the start of the flower phase. Companion plants have been continually planted since week 5 of the vegetative phase. The various companion plants has kept Ladybugs around and they are unaffected by the neem oil as well as bees which is important when spraying pesticides outdoors. Fortunately. Ladybugs prey on aphids so in combination with the neem oil sprays it should clear the aphid issue.</p>

        <h3>Week 7 <i class="fas fa-calendar-alt"></i></h3>
        <p>The plant was supercropped and weaved into the trellis to expand the plant’s footprint or canopy outwards as much as possible before it’s final stretching phase in early flower. In addition to the soil, the Strawberry Cough plant is being fed with General Hydroponics FloraNova Grow daily with a flush on the seventh day of every week in the vegetative phase outdoors.</p>

        <div class="grow-content-weekly">
        <h3>Week 2 <i class="fas fa-calendar-alt"></i></h3>
        <p>The Strawberry Cough plant has stretched and has received a 2nd layer of trellis to support the branches before the buds bloom out. The regular neem oil applications have stopped from week 1 of the flower phase onwards.</p>

        <h3>Week 3 <i class="fas fa-calendar-alt"></i></h3>
        <p>The ladybugs are still flying around and keeping the garden looking clean. I have not spotted any aphids since starting the regular spray applications of the Garden Safe neem oil extract back in week 5 of the vegetative phase. Another great neem oil extract product that I have personally used is Dyna-Gro’s neem oil.</p>

        <div class="grow-content-weekly">
        <h3>Week 5 <i class="fas fa-calendar-alt"></i></h3>
        <p>The buds are coming in nicely in week 5 of flower and are smelling like ripe strawberries and very fruity overall. The structure looks nice and the plants have been free of pests. I have started to feed the plant with some additional <a href="https://www.planetnatural.com/product/liquid-budswel/">Budswel Liquid by the Guano Company</a> for the next 3 weeks prior to flushing.</p>

        <p>Plants are now being flushed daily at the start of week 8 of the flower stage in preparation for harvest at the beginning of week 10 or 11.</p>
