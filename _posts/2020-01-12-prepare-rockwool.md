#### What is Rockwool?
Growers use rockwool cubes for propagation and blocks for vegetative and flowering cannabis plants. Rockwool is a porous growing medium that has water retention capabilities similar to sand. The same material has also been used as insulation prior to its use as a growing medium. It has a limited water-buffering capacity which could easily adversely affect the quality of a plant's life. This particular growing medium usually has a high initial pH level (also known as high alkalinity) which needs to be lowered before planting. Soaking the rockwool as a way of preparation which can correct the pH level of the substrate. Even if the rockwool has an adjusted pH prior to preparation by manufacturers, soaking rockwool can help ensure that the medium drains sufficiently as it usually ships completely dry (7).

Did you know? Pele's hair is basaltic glass fibers or strands that are formed from lava ejected from volcanoes into the air and being blown by the wind which stretches and cools them (5). This material is identical to rockwool and can be found in Hawaii where conditions can be ideal. This image is from Geology.com (6).

Rockwool is a naturally alkaline growing medium that is manufactured by taking basalt rock and melting it at an extremely high temperature (3000°F+) and then blown and pushed into a large spinning chamber that pulls and spins the material into fibers. The fibers are then compressed into large mats which can then be cut into the various cubes, blocks, and slabs that growers are familiar with and are held together using a binding agent (4). Other forms of stone wool such as granulate is available and can be added to various potting mixes to improve aeration or tilth. The high temperatures used during the manufacturing process render the substrate inert. Since rockwool is inert, there are no naturally occurring nutrients such as potassium which is sometimes found in coco. Also, there are no beneficial microbes and they may have slower initial growth as there are lower levels of carbon within the substrate until plant growth has been established. Rockwool is actually a company name that went on to become the generic term for this type of product material known as stone wool (8). Companies like Grodan and Cultilene are more known for creating stone or mineral wool that is used in cultivation. Grodan also has a brand known as ParGro which is an alternative to Grodan.

#### Why Prepare Rockwool?
Preparing rockwool cubes, blocks, and slabs before use is crucial to maximize the efficiency of it as a medium. Without the preparation of the rockwool medium, the pH will be unstable which can cause deficiencies and nutrient lock out issues for cannabis growers. Not only will the quality of the cannabis plant's life diminish, but the quality of the end product can also suffer as a result (3). Another reason to prepare the rockwool medium is to ensure that it drains sufficiently during irrigation.

#### Prep Rockwool For Cultivation
Unlike most other media, rockwool is shipped completely dry and this makes the initial soaking or feeding more crucial. Preparation of the rockwool for use can range from a quick submerge into the nutrient solution to soaking into the nutrient solution for several hours depending on what system works best for your grow.

Use distilled water or filtered water to soak rockwool for several hours in a light nutrient solution with a pH balance of 4.5. A bin, tote, or sink can be used to hold about 4-5 gallons of nutrient solution and the rockwool can be placed inside. The rockwool will initially float, but will sink to the bottom as it absorbs water. 

After several hours, you can remove the rockwool from the nutrient solution and test the pH runoff of your cubes. Ideally you want the pH runoff to be in a range of 5.5 - 5.9. If the pH runoff is testing higher than this range, then repeat the soaking process to ensure the pH is at the right level. The soaking neutralizes the natural alkalinity of rockwool which makes it more suitable for cannabis cultivation. When you are done soaking your rockwool cubes, discard the used nutrient solution.
