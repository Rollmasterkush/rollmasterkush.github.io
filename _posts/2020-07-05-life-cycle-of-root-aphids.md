#### What is Butter Coffee?
Butter coffee is coffee paired with MCT oil, butter, ghee, or coconut oil. If you followed my previous blog post, [Making Coconut Oil Infused with Concentrates](https://rollingmountainkush.com/may2020/2020/05/31/infused-coconut-oil.html), you can infuse your cannabis concentrates with coconut oil and then use the infused coconut oil as part of this recipe. Butter coffee is high in fat which is supposedly good for energy especially by pairing it with coffee which contains caffeine. The fat and caffeine content will also help curb your hunger which is why butter coffee is often viewed as a replacement to breakfast. Foods such as butter, ghee, and coconut oil are high in saturated fats which are generally considered unhealthy because of its increased risk of cardiovascular complications. The 2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends limiting saturated fats in your diet to 7% or less of your total intake. For a 2,000 calorie diet, that means limiting your saturated fat intake to 22g of saturated fat or less.  Individuals who are more active can benefit from eating more saturated fat, depending on the food source. Not all saturated fats are created equal, coconut oil is good for your HDL cholesterol levels as well as containing certain antioxidants. Butter has approximately 7g of saturated fat per tablespoon and coconut oil has about 12g of saturated fat per tablespoon for comparison. 



#### Butter Coffee Infused
After infusing your butter or coconut oil, you will be able to easily add it to your coffee which turns your coffee into butter coffee. Butter coffee typically calls for 2 cups of coffee with 1-2 tablespoons of your preferred butter or oil. That’s how simple it is. Brew your coffee as you normally would, then add your infused butter or oil while the coffee is hot. Cold brew coffee can be used as an alternative to regular coffee as it boasts a lower acidity which is less upsetting to the stomach.
