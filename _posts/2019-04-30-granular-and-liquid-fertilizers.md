* Types of Fertilizers
* Granular Fertilizers
* Liquid Fertilizers
* Factors To Consider

When considering how to grow your cannabis a couple of the questions are what sorts of nutrients to use and how to apply them. Before considering what nutrient line to use or which assortment of nutrient products you should use, you should consider the practicalness of granular and liquid fertilizers depending on several factors including: cost, equipment, and style of application. 

#### Types of Fertilizers
Broadly speaking, there are two main categories of fertilizers: granular and liquid (Isleib, 2016). Both granular and liquid fertilizers have their own advantages depending on the several factors listed above and can be used in unison throughout the grow cycle. 

#### Granular Fertilizers
Granular fertilizers typically consist of small particles and can be separate or mixed into blends. These sorts of fertilizers can be placed directly into the growing medium during transplant or mixed into the watering feed to be applied. An example of granular fertilizers that can be applied directly to the growing medium during transplant is Xtreme Gardening Mykos, Elite 91 Myco Jordan, and Plant Success Great White Mycos.

#### Liquid Fertilizers
Liquid fertilizers have been extremely popular among both residential and commercial cannabis grows, but over the past several years granular fertilizers have been gaining in popularity because of their own advantages. Unlike granular fertilizers, liquid fertilizers can be both ground applied and foliar applied. Foliar applications allows nutrients to be more readily absorbed than ground application through the leaves of the cannabis plants. It is important to note that the availability of the nutrients when applied this way is much shorter than ground application. This is why foliar applications are a great method to correct nutrient deficiencies in the short-term or to provide an additional nutrient boost rather than as part of a regular nutrient schedule (UF, 2013). Some examples of popular liquid fertilizers that can be applied as part of a nutrient schedule and as a foliar application include Kimtec Bombardier, Cyco Potash, and General Hydroponics Diamond Nectar.

#### Factors To Consider
Overall, there are several factors to consider when choosing between liquid and granular fertilizers such as nutrient mobility, salt content, blending, cost, storage, and application methods.

* Nutrient Mobility: phosphorus is less mobile and cannot move closer to the root system than the individual granule that contains it. Liquid form may be preferred. 
* Salt Content: since liquid fertilizers are heavily diluted with water, they are easier to mix and feed plants without burning them with excessively high salt content. 
* Blending: granular fertilizers are more difficult to blend than liquid fertilizers. 
* Cost: granular fertilizers can be cheaper to operate on than liquid fertilizers using cost-per-gallon feed calculations. 
* Storage: granular fertilizers are easier to store, they do not settle out over time or salt out in cold weather. 
* Application: even though liquid fertilizers can be applied through a foliar application and granular fertilizers cannot, granular fertilizers are most efficient for heavy pre-plant applications such as microbes for transplants.

#### Conclusion
There is no one-size-fits-all for providing nutrients to your plants. Many gardeners and cannabis growers use a combination of both types of fertilizers. Granular fertilizers can be effective at supplying nutrients long-term without consistent re-application and liquid fertilizers can be mixed as nutrient feed or a foliar application. According to the Michigan State University website, one type of nutrients is not recommended over the other. Instead farmers should analyze each scenario separately considering costs, application, and ease of use when making fertilizer decisions.
