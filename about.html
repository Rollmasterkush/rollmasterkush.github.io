        <hr>
        
        <p>RMK has been entrenched in Colorado indoor cannabis culture since 2015 exploring all sorts of cannabis growing methods and strives to produce some of the most potent and cleanest cannabis buds, with a wide array of genetics from across the globe.</p>
        
        <p>RMK was founded in late 2018 by grower David "Roll" as a personal online cannabis cultivation blog and grow log presenting my results in the form of case studies detailing my various cannabis growing adventures. I am experienced in commercial and residential cannabis growing and I hope my website can serve as an interesting read at the least for cultivators and anyone else. Check back on this website occassionally as I am always updating current information and providing new information!</p>
