        <hr>
        <p>Entrenched in Colorado indoor cannabis culture since 2015, David has been in the commercial cannabis industry for several years with a Private Applicator license. RMK remains committed to producing some of the most potent and cleanest cannabis buds, with a wide array of genetics and breeders to choose from across the globe.</p>
        <p>RMK is based out of Denver, Colorado USA. It was founded in late 2018 by grower David Roll as a personal online cannabis cultivation blog and grow log or case studies of my various cannabis growing adventures. I have experience in commercial and residential cannabis growing which combine to offer a somewhat unique perspective on how best to grow cannabis. Hopefully my website can serve as a guide for growers who cannot gain access to cannabis through stores and for individuals who want to learn more about cultivation. Check back on this website occassionally as I am always updating current information and providing new information!</p>
        <p>RMK has a mission and it is finding the most coveted cannabis strains and determining which methods of growing are best dependent upon several variables. It is all about quality over here. Hopefully, together as a community we can change the cannabis cultivation culture for the better. I take cannabis growing seriously and when it is time to work I hope you will too. Collecting data and applying proven scientific methods are just part of the best practices that must be employed to improve the state of your cannabis grow. Let's raise the bar in what it means to cultivate cannabis!</p>
