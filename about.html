        <hr>
        
        <p style="padding:20px;">Growing cannabis residentially or in a commercial environment are completely different for several reasons whether its scale, organization, or equipment. Growing top quality cannabis requires a hands-on approach in many other aspects besides cultivation including troubleshooting equipment malfunctions, building out new grow facilities, or managing personnel effectively. Through experience, RMK seeks to research the best approach.</p>
        
        <p style="padding:20px;">Having the right horticulture mindset is the foundation for any superb harvest. In a commercial setting, utilizing a team's strengths, recognizing weaknesses, implementing pest prevention, and adequately handling pest pressure are just some of the first measures that can be taken to improve a facility. In a residential setting, understanding every aspect of the grow from propagation to harvest is necessary while also being able to setup and troubleshoot equipment to be on the right track. </p>
